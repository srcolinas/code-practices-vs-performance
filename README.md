# code-practices-vs-performance

I have always have a passion for software design best practices and how they lead to easier to maintain codebases. However, I watched [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU) that made me think of how those practices relate to performance; therefore, I decided to go deeper on the subject and see how it applies to other languages. Now, the goal is not to define a clear cut of what practices to use or when; I believe that depends on the project being build and the timeline for the development of that project and the business it impacts.

## Practices

Here we keep track of what practices are being analized and in which language. Feel free to make a PR to add a new practice or language that you would like to see.



| Practice    | C++         | Python      | Rust        | Go |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Polymorphism vs if statements  | | | |  |
| Knowing the internals   | | | |  |
| Size of functions   | | | |  |
